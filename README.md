# Live Transcription App

This project contains the user web application for the Wisharoo product.  

## Introduction

This is a real-time transcription tool built with the Qt framework. This application leverages the Vosk speech recognition toolkit to transcribe spoken language into text in real-time. 

Please note that the current version of the application has some performance issues, with a transcription time of approximately 10 seconds for a stream of audio. However,  I am actively working on improving the speed and adding new features to enhance your transcription experience.

## Features

The current version of the Live Transcription App offers the following features:

- Real-time audio transcription: Transcribe spoken language into text as it is being spoken.
- Qt-based graphical user interface for ease of use.
- Integration with the Vosk speech recognition toolkit.
- Save and export transcriptions to text files.
